      <h1>The secret ingredient</h1>
      <div class="center">
        <p class="p1">
            The recipe for the delicious waffle batter was perfected in the kitchen of a dedicated mother and father who supported their daughter's business endeavors. The result was the most exquisite "crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside" waffle you have ever tasted, thanks to the mother's generous helping of imagination, indulgence, flavor, and love.

      <h1>Our journey so far.....</h1>
      <div class="center">
        <P class="p1">
            Our small business endeavor began on the "streets" of the stunning city of Durban. We made the decision early on in our business to never skimp on ingredient quality. Our imported Belgian chocolate, which we use to coat our waffles, is one of our distinguishing ingredientsâ€”and something we are really proud of. The milk, white, dark, caramel, and ruby chocolate varieties of the silky, smooth Belgian chocolate provide our tasters an endless array of delectable flavors to choose from. We now have a location in Randburg, Johannesburg, where you can enjoy all of our delicious waffles. We provide a variety of intriguing toppings to go along with our chocolate grandeur, each carefully chosen to satisfy a distinct palate.
